## Getting Started

When you first run the application, it will create an empty database. You can start adding your own mix CDs right away using the "Add New CD" feature in either the GUI or command-line version.

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
- Make sure your Last.fm credentials are correct
- Check that you've authorized the application in your browser
- Try resetting credentials from the main menu

### Scrobble Failures
- Verify your internet connection
- Some tracks may be ignored if they're duplicates
- Check the status console for detailed error messages

### Track Format Issues
- Ensure tracks follow the "Artist - Title [Album]" format
- Use the preview feature when adding new CDs
- Album names are optional but recommended
